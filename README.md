 Sylheti Nagri Lipi Recognition and Translation

This project focuses on recognizing Sylheti Nagri Lipi characters from images and converting them into machine-readable text. The system uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image recognition and Natural Language Processing (NLP) for further text analysis and translation.

Project Overview

Sylheti Nagri is a script used to write the Sylheti language, spoken in the Sylhet region of Bangladesh. The goal of this project is to preserve this almost extinct language by automating the recognition of Sylheti Nagri script through deep learning techniques. This system uses CNNs for recognizing characters from images and NLP for processing and translating recognized text into machine-readable formats (such as Bangla or English).

Key Features

Character Recognition: Uses CNN-based models to recognize Sylheti Nagri characters from images.

Text Translation: After recognizing the characters, the system translates them into Bangla or English using NLP techniques.

Preservation of Language: Digitizes the Sylheti Nagri script to make it more accessible and easier to preserve.
